\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent Fake news has rapidly become a social issue, with people using it to spread misleading or rumoured information in order to influence the behaviour of the general public. During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, the proliferation of fake news revealed not only the risks of fake news's consequences, but also the difficulties of separating fake news from real news. While the word "fake news" is recent, it is not actually a new phenomenon. Fake news has been around since the 19th century, when one-sided, partisan newspapers first appeared and became popular. However, technological innovations and the distribution of news through multiple forms of media have amplified the propagation of false news today. As such, the effects of fake news have increased exponentially in the recent past and something must be done to prevent this from continuing in the future.\\[\baselineskip ] \indent Therefore, our goal is to use machine learning to classify, at least as well as humans, more difficult discrepancies between real and fake news. There are two methods by which machines could attempt to solve the fake news problem better than humans. The first is that machines are better at detecting and keeping track of statistics than humans. Additionally, machines may be more efficient in surveying a knowledge base to find all relevant articles and answering based on those many different sources. Either of these methods could prove useful in detecting fake news. In this project, both these techniques have been used to predict fake news. We have used supervised learning in order to make a binary classifier that will predict fake news only within the source in question. Furthermore, to make the project dynamic in nature we have implemented the second technique of automatic surveying through the use of web page scraping and databases. The goal of this project is to find the effectiveness and limitations of language-based techniques for detection of fake news through the use of machine learning algorithms and computerised surveying. This type of solution is intended to be an end-to end solution for fake news detection. The project however, at times cannot predict fake news with complete certainty. \\[\baselineskip ] \indent With that being said, the project is intended to be used as a tool and it is close to an end to end solution. This tool can be used for future applications and can be combined with other tools to provide much better results in fake news detection. }{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
